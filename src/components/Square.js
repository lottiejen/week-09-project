// Create a component <Square> that displays a square <div> that is 200Ã—200px and has a red background. You'll need to look at the React docs and how to use the style attribute.



const Square = () => ( 

    <div style={{
        background: "#f00",
        width: "200px",
        height: "200px",
    }} />
);

export default Square;
